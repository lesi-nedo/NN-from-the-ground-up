In this project, we developed a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network from scratch to address both classification and regression tasks. 
The classification task involved solving MONK's problems, while the regression task focused on predicting 3D coordinates (x, y, z) from the CUP dataset. 
The final model used an MLP with task-specific activation functions (e.g., Sigmoid, LeakyReLU) and was optimized using techniques like grid search and Nesterov momentum. 
Validation for the MONK's problems was performed using early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization. 
For the CUP dataset, we employed a hold-out technique, splitting it into 64% training, 16% validation, and 20% internal test sets, ensuring robust evaluation.
